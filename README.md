# Just created a to do list application with python and django to recall my CRUD, login, logout, Authentication and Data interpretation concepts.
# I made a login and registration system for users to store their Todo list.
# then used django models to stored each todo with their uses's id.
# And made login or registration mandotory to store todo.
